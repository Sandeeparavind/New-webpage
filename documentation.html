<p>
<p>Have developed a CRUD application with JWT authentication, which can create new recipes, update the existing ones and delete the recipes as well. The purpose of this application is to have a user-friendly UI for an interactive recipe menu. Have used FIREBASE framework for backend and database. The functions and the breakdown of the application and its components:
</p>
<p>To summarize, the application post authentication, can be used to view the recipes, add, delete and edit the recipes with parameters like, name, image URL, description of the recipe and ingredients needed. About the ingredients, there is an option to add them to shopping list where we can add how many ever ingredients we want. In case of unfortunate event where the application is closed, with the use of JWT, the user is auto logged in and the expiration date of the token is one hour, after which the user is logged out automatically. 
</p>
<p>To get the data, we must navigate through the navigation bar and press Manage->Fetch data.
</p>
<p>After performing the necessary operation, you can press Manage->Save data to commit permanent changes with the database. And you can logout of the application. 
</p>
There is also an option to create a new user in the beginning of the application.
